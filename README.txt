This code reproduces all figures from the manuscript titled "Comprehensive transcriptional map of primate brain development". All code was written in the R programming language and is contained within an R Studio project (https://www.rstudio.com/). Clone the project locally, open the R Studio project, and set the working directory to 'reports'. Note that this project includes large data files (>100 Mb) that will not be downloaded using the 'Download ZIP' link. To generate figures, run scripts from 'src' and knit markdown documents in 'reports'.
